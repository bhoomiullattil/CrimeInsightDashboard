Crime studies conclude that crime does not occur evenly across urban landscapes but concentrates in certain areas. In India, there is a strong need of Crime Surveillance
system. Identifying the Crime hotspots can help in taking corrective measures related to crimes. In the current era, many traditional Hotspot analysis techniques are used 
but improvements are still needed for getting efficient output as crime hotspots (areas with high intensity of crimes). 

A major challenge faced by most of the law enforcement and intelligence organisations is efficiently and accurately analysing the growing volumes of crime related data. 
The vast geographical diversity and the complexity of crime patterns have made the analysing and recording of crime data more difficult. 

Data Visualisation can be used to analyse large datasets and derive important analytical results. The proposed system collects data from various sources like media, removes
redundant Information, flattens and visualises the data. Web Scrapers are to be used for obtaining the raw data while Tableau is to be used for performing visualisations. 

The proposed system consists of a rich and simplified environment that can be used effectively for processes of crime analysis. The proposed system could be used to 
identify region wise count of crimes and take precautionary measures to prevent crimes in the identified hotspots.
